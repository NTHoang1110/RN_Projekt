    32	Project Gutenberg Etext of A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare
    33	******This file should be named 2ws1710.txt or 2ws1710.zip******
    34	
    35	Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 2ws1711.txt
    36	VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 2ws1710a.txt
    37	
    38	
    39	This etext was prepared by the PG Shakespeare Team,
    40	a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers.
    41	
    42	
    43	Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    44	all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    45	copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep
    46	these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    47	
    48	
    49	We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    50	of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    51	
    52	Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    53	midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    54	The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    55	Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    56	preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    57	and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    58	up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    59	in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    60	a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    61	look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    62	new copy has at least one byte more or less.
    63

    65	Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    66	
    67	We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    68	time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    69	to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    70	searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    71	projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    72	per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    73	million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    74	files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    75	If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    76	total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    77	
    78	The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    79	Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    80	This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    81	which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    82	
    83	At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    84	of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    85	manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    86	from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    87	assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    88	more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    89	don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
    90	
    91	We need your donations more than ever!
    92	
    93	
    94	All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are

   149	Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   150	They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   151	your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   152	someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   153	fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   154	disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   155	you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   156	
   157	*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   158	By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   159	etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   160	this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   161	a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   162	sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   163	you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   164	medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   165	
   166	ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   167	This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   168	tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   169	Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   170	Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   171	things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   172	on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   173	distribute it in the United States without permission and
   174	without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   175	below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   176	under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   177	
   178	To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   179	efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   180	works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   181	medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   182	things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   183	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   184	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   185	disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   186	codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   187	
   188	LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   189	But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   190	[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   191	etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   192	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   193	legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   194	UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   195	INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   196	OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   197	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   198	
   199	If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   200	receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   201	you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   202	time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   203	on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   204	such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   205	copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   206	choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   207	receive it electronically.
   208	
   209	THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   210	WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

   213	PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   214

   221	You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,

   339	SCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of THESEUS.
   340	
   341	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants.]
   342	
   343	THESEUS
   344	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
   345	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
   346	Another moon; but, oh, methinks, how slow
   347	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
   348	Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
   349	Long withering out a young man's revenue.
   350	
   351	HIPPOLYTA
   352	Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights;
   353	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
   354	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
   355	New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
   356	Of our solemnities.
   357	
   358	THESEUS
   359	                    Go, Philostrate,
   360	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
   361	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
   362	Turn melancholy forth to funerals--
   363	The pale companion is not for our pomp. --
   364	
   365	[Exit PHILOSTRATE.]
   366	
   367	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
   368	And won thy love doing thee injuries;
   369	But I will wed thee in another key,
   370	With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
   371	
   372	[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS.]
   373	
   374	EGEUS
   375	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
   376	
   377	THESEUS
   378	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
   379	
   380	EGEUS
   381	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
   382	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.--
   383	Stand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,
   384	This man hath my consent to marry her:--
   385	Stand forth, Lysander;--and, my gracious duke,
   386	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.
   387	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
   388	And interchang'd love-tokens with my child:
   389	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
   390	With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
   391	And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
   392	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
   393	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers
   394	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--
   395	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
   396	Turned her obedience, which is due to me,
   397	To stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,
   398	Be it so she will not here before your grace
   399	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
   400	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,--
   401	As she is mine I may dispose of her:
   402	Which shall be either to this gentleman
   403	Or to her death; according to our law
   404	Immediately provided in that case.
   405	
   406	THESEUS
   407	What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid:
   408	To you your father should be as a god;
   409	One that compos'd your beauties: yea, and one
   410	To whom you are but as a form in wax,
   411	By him imprinted, and within his power
   412	To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
   413	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
   414	
   415	HERMIA
   416	So is Lysander.
   417	
   418	THESEUS
   419	                In himself he is:
   420	But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
   421	The other must be held the worthier.
   422	
   423	HERMIA
   424	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
   425	
   426	THESEUS
   427	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
   428	
   429	HERMIA
   430	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
   431	I know not by what power I am made bold,
   432	Nor how it may concern my modesty
   433	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
   434	But I beseech your grace that I may know
   435	The worst that may befall me in this case
   436	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
   437	
   438	THESEUS
   439	Either to die the death, or to abjure
   440	For ever the society of men.
   441	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
   442	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
   443	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
   444	You can endure the livery of a nun;
   445	For aye to be shady cloister mew'd,
   446	To live a barren sister all your life,
   447	Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.
   448	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
   449	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage:
   450	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
   451	Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
   452	Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
   453	
   454	HERMIA
   455	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
   456	Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
   457	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
   458	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
   459	
   460	THESEUS
   461	Take time to pause; and by the next new moon,--
   462	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
   463	For everlasting bond of fellowship,--
   464	Upon that day either prepare to die
   465	For disobedience to your father's will;
   466	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
   467	Or on Diana's altar to protest
   468	For aye austerity and single life.
   469	
   470	DEMETRIUS
   471	Relent, sweet Hermia;--and, Lysander, yield
   472	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
   473	
   474	LYSANDER
   475	You have her father's love, Demetrius;
   476	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
   477	
   478	EGEUS
   479	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love;
   480	And what is mine my love shall render him;
   481	And she is mine; and all my right of her
   482	I do estate unto Demetrius.
   483	
   484	LYSANDER
   485	I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
   486	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
   487	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
   488	If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;
   489	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
   490	I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:
   491	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
   492	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
   493	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
   494	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
   495	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
   496	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
   497	
   498	THESEUS
   499	I must confess that I have heard so much,
   500	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
   501	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
   502	My mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come;
   503	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;
   504	I have some private schooling for you both.--
   505	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
   506	To fit your fancies to your father's will,
   507	Or else the law of Athens yields you up,--
   508	Which by no means we may extenuate,--
   509	To death, or to a vow of single life.--
   510	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
   511	Demetrius, and Egeus, go along;
   512	I must employ you in some business
   513	Against our nuptial, and confer with you
   514	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
   515	
   516	EGEUS
   517	With duty and desire we follow you.
   518	
   519	[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, DEMETRIUS, and Train.]
   520	
   521	LYSANDER
   522	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
   523	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
   524	
   525	HERMIA
   526	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
   527	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
   528	
   529	LYSANDER
   530	Ah me! for aught that I could ever read,
   531	Could ever hear by tale or history,
   532	The course of true love never did run smooth:
   533	But either it was different in blood,--
   534	
   535	HERMIA
   536	O cross! Too high to be enthrall'd to low!
   537	
   538	LYSANDER
   539	Or else misgraffed in respect of years;--
   540	
   541	HERMIA
   542	O spite! Too old to be engag'd to young!
   543	
   544	LYSANDER
   545	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends:
   546	
   547	HERMIA
   548	O hell! to choose love by another's eye!
   549	
   550	LYSANDER
   551	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
   552	War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,
   553	Making it momentary as a sound,
   554	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
   555	Brief as the lightning in the collied night
   556	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
   557	And ere a man hath power to say, Behold!
   558	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
   559	So quick bright things come to confusion.
   560	
   561	HERMIA
   562	If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
   563	It stands as an edict in destiny:
   564	Then let us teach our trial patience,
   565	Because it is a customary cross;
   566	As due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,
   567	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
   568	
   569	LYSANDER
   570	A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
   571	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
   572	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
   573	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
   574	And she respects me as her only son.
   575	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
   576	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
   577	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
   578	Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;
   579	And in the wood, a league without the town,
   580	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
   581	To do observance to a morn of May,
   582	There will I stay for thee.
   583	
   584	HERMIA
   585	                            My good Lysander!
   586	I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
   587	By his best arrow, with the golden head,
   588	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
   589	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
   590	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
   591	When the false Trojan under sail was seen,--
   592	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
   593	In number more than ever women spoke,--
   594	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
   595	Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
   596	
   597	LYSANDER
   598	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
   599	
   600	[Enter HELENA.]
   601	
   602	HERMIA
   603	God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
   604	
   605	HELENA
   606	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
   607	Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
   608	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
   609	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
   610	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
   611	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
   612	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
   613	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
   614	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
   615	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
   616	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
   617	O, teach me how you look; and with what art
   618	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
   619	
   620	HERMIA
   621	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
   622	
   623	HELENA
   624	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
   625	
   626	HERMIA
   627	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
   628	
   629	HELENA
   630	O that my prayers could such affection move!
   631	
   632	HERMIA
   633	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
   634	
   635	HELENA
   636	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
   637	
   638	HERMIA
   639	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
   640	
   641	HELENA
   642	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
   643	
   644	HERMIA
   645	Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;
   646	Lysander and myself will fly this place.--
   647	Before the time I did Lysander see,
   648	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
   649	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
   650	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!
   651	
   652	LYSANDER
   653	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
   654	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
   655	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
   656	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--
   657	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--
   658	Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
   659	
   660	HERMIA
   661	And in the wood where often you and I
   662	Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
   663	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
   664	There my Lysander and myself shall meet:
   665	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
   666	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
   667	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,
   668	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!--
   669	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
   670	From lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.
   671	
   672	LYSANDER
   673	I will, my Hermia.
   674	
   675	[Exit HERMIA.]
   676	
   677	LYSANDER
   678	                   Helena, adieu:
   679	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
   680	
   681	[Exit LYSANDER.]
   682	
   683	HELENA
   684	How happy some o'er other some can be!
   685	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
   686	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
   687	He will not know what all but he do know.
   688	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
   689	So I, admiring of his qualities.
   690	Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
   691	Love can transpose to form and dignity.
   692	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
   693	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
   694	Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
   695	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
   696	And therefore is love said to be a child,
   697	Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
   698	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
   699	So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere:
   700	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
   701	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
   702	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
   703	So he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt.
   704	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;
   705	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
   706	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
   707	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
   708	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
   709	To have his sight thither and back again.
   710	
   711	[Exit HELENA.]
   712	
   713	
   714	
   715	SCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage.
   716	
   717	[Enter SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, QUINCE, and STARVELING.]
   718	
   719	QUINCE
   720	Is all our company here?
   721	
   722	BOTTOM
   723	You were best to call them generally, man by man,
   724	according to the scrip.
   725	
   726	QUINCE
   727	Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought
   728	fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the
   729	duke and duchess on his wedding-day at night.
   730	
   731	BOTTOM
   732	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on;
   733	then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
   734	
   735	QUINCE
   736	Marry, our play is--The most lamentable comedy and most
   737	cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
   738	
   739	BOTTOM
   740	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.--
   741	Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.--
   742	Masters, spread yourselves.
   743	
   744	QUINCE
   745	Answer, as I call you.--Nick Bottom, the weaver.
   746	
   747	BOTTOM
   748	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
   749	
   750	QUINCE
   751	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
   752	
   753	BOTTOM
   754	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
   755	
   756	QUINCE
   757	A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
   758	
   759	BOTTOM
   760	That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
   761	If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move
   762	storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest:--yet my
   763	chief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a
   764	part to tear a cat in, to make all split.
   765	
   766	The raging rocks
   767	And shivering shocks
   768	Shall break the locks
   769	    Of prison gates:
   770	
   771	And Phibbus' car
   772	Shall shine from far,
   773	And make and mar
   774	    The foolish Fates.
   775	
   776	This was lofty.--Now name the rest of the players.--This is
   777	Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.
   778	
   779	QUINCE
   780	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
   781	
   782	FLUTE
   783	Here, Peter Quince.
   784	
   785	QUINCE
   786	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
   787	
   788	FLUTE
   789	What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
   790	
   791	QUINCE
   792	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
   793	
   794	FLUTE
   795	Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
   796	
   797	QUINCE
   798	That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as
   799	small as you will.
   800	
   801	BOTTOM
   802	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too:
   803	I'll speak in a monstrous little voice;--'Thisne, Thisne!'--
   804	'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady dear!'
   805	
   806	QUINCE
   807	No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.
   808	
   809	BOTTOM
   810	Well, proceed.
   811	
   812	QUINCE
   813	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
   814	
   815	STARVELING
   816	Here, Peter Quince.
   817	
   818	QUINCE
   819	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.--
   820	Tom Snout, the tinker.
   821	
   822	SNOUT
   823	Here, Peter Quince.
   824	
   825	QUINCE
   826	You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father;--Snug,
   827	the joiner, you, the lion's part:--and, I hope, here is a play
   828	fitted.
   829	
   830	SNUG
   831	Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it
   832	me, for I am slow of study.
   833	
   834	QUINCE
   835	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
   836	
   837	BOTTOM
   838	Let me play the lion too: I will roar that I will do
   839	any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the
   840	duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'
   841	
   842	QUINCE
   843	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the
   844	duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were
   845	enough to hang us all.
   846	
   847	ALL
   848	That would hang us every mother's son.
   849	
   850	BOTTOM
   851	I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies
   852	out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang
   853	us: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as
   854	gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
   855	nightingale.
   856	
   857	QUINCE
   858	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
   859	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
   860	day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
   861	needs play Pyramus.
   862	
   863	BOTTOM
   864	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?
   865	
   866	QUINCE
   867	Why, what you will.
   868	
   869	BOTTOM
   870	I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,
   871	your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your
   872	French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.
   873	
   874	QUINCE
   875	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
   876	then you will play bare-faced.-- But, masters, here are your
   877	parts: and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to
   878	con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a
   879	mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse: for
   880	if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our
   881	devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties,
   882	such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.
   883	
   884	BOTTOM
   885	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely
   886	and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.
   887	
   888	QUINCE
   889	At the duke's oak we meet.
   890	
   891	BOTTOM
   892	Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings.
   893	
   894	[Exeunt.]
   895	
   896	
   897	ACT II.
   898	
   899	
   900	SCENE I. A wood near Athens.
   901	
   902	[Enter a FAIRY at One door, and PUCK at another.]
   903	
   904	PUCK
   905	How now, spirit! whither wander you?
   906	
   907	FAIRY
   908	    Over hill, over dale,
   909	      Thorough bush, thorough brier,
   910	    Over park, over pale,
   911	      Thorough flood, thorough fire,
   912	    I do wander everywhere,
   913	    Swifter than the moon's sphere;
   914	    And I serve the fairy queen,
   915	    To dew her orbs upon the green.
   916	    The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
   917	    In their gold coats spots you see;
   918	    Those be rubies, fairy favours,
   919	    In those freckles live their savours;
   920	I must go seek some dew-drops here,
   921	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
   922	Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
   923	Our queen and all her elves come here anon.
   924	
   925	PUCK
   926	The king doth keep his revels here to-night;
   927	Take heed the Queen come not within his sight.
   928	For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
   929	Because that she, as her attendant, hath
   930	A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;
   931	She never had so sweet a changeling:
   932	And jealous Oberon would have the child
   933	Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:
   934	But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
   935	Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:
   936	And now they never meet in grove or green,
   937	By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
   938	But they do square; that all their elves for fear
   939	Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.
   940	
   941	FAIRY
   942	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
   943	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
   944	Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
   945	That frights the maidens of the villagery;
   946	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
   947	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
   948	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
   949	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
   950	Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
   951	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
   952	Are not you he?
   953	
   954	PUCK
   955	                Thou speak'st aright;
   956	I am that merry wanderer of the night.
   957	I jest to Oberon, and make him smile,
   958	When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
   959	Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
   960	And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
   961	In very likeness of a roasted crab;
   962	And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,
   963	And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
   964	The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
   965	Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
   966	Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
   967	And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
   968	And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe,
   969	And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
   970	A merrier hour was never wasted there.--
   971	But room, fairy, here comes Oberon.
   972	
   973	FAIRY
   974	And here my mistress.--Would that he were gone!
   975	
   976	[Enter OBERON at one door, with his Train, and TITANIA,
   977	at another, with hers.]
   978	
   979	OBERON
   980	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
   981	
   982	TITANIA
   983	What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;
   984	I have forsworn his bed and company.
   985	
   986	OBERON
   987	Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
   988	
   989	TITANIA
   990	Then I must be thy lady; but I know
   991	When thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,
   992	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
   993	Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
   994	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
   995	Come from the farthest steep of India,
   996	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
   997	Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
   998	To Theseus must be wedded; and you come
   999	To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  1000	
  1001	OBERON
  1002	How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
  1003	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
  1004	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
  1005	Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
  1006	From Perigenia, whom he ravish'd?
  1007	And make him with fair Aegle break his faith,
  1008	With Ariadne and Antiopa?
  1009	
  1010	TITANIA
  1011	These are the forgeries of jealousy:
  1012	And never, since the middle summer's spring,
  1013	Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
  1014	By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,
  1015	Or on the beached margent of the sea,
  1016	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
  1017	But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
  1018	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
  1019	As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
  1020	Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
  1021	Hath every pelting river made so proud
  1022	That they have overborne their continents:
  1023	The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
  1024	The ploughman lost his sweat; and the green corn
  1025	Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:
  1026	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
  1027	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
  1028	The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud;
  1029	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
  1030	For lack of tread, are undistinguishable:
  1031	The human mortals want their winter here;
  1032	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:--
  1033	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
  1034	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
  1035	That rheumatic diseases do abound:
  1036	And thorough this distemperature we see
  1037	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
  1038	Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
  1039	And on old Hyem's thin and icy crown
  1040	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
  1041	Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
  1042	The childing autumn, angry winter, change
  1043	Their wonted liveries; and the maz'd world,
  1044	By their increase, now knows not which is which:
  1045	And this same progeny of evils comes
  1046	From our debate, from our dissension:
  1047	We are their parents and original.
  1048	
  1049	OBERON
  1050	Do you amend it, then: it lies in you:
  1051	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
  1052	I do but beg a little changeling boy
  1053	To be my henchman.
  1054	
  1055	TITANIA
  1056	                   Set your heart at rest;
  1057	The fairy-land buys not the child of me.
  1058	His mother was a vot'ress of my order:
  1059	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
  1060	Full often hath she gossip'd by my side;
  1061	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
  1062	Marking the embarked traders on the flood;
  1063	When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,
  1064	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
  1065	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
  1066	Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
  1067	Would imitate; and sail upon the land,
  1068	To fetch me trifles, and return again,
  1069	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
  1070	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
  1071	And for her sake do I rear up her boy:
  1072	And for her sake I will not part with him.
  1073	
  1074	OBERON
  1075	How long within this wood intend you stay?
  1076	
  1077	TITANIA
  1078	Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
  1079	If you will patiently dance in our round,
  1080	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
  1081	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
  1082	
  1083	OBERON
  1084	Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
  1085	
  1086	TITANIA
  1087	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away:
  1088	We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
  1089	
  1090	[Exit TITANIA with her Train.]
  1091	
  1092	OBERON
  1093	Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
  1094	Till I torment thee for this injury.--
  1095	My gentle Puck, come hither: thou remember'st
  1096	Since once I sat upon a promontory,
  1097	And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back,
  1098	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,
  1099	That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
  1100	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
  1101	To hear the sea-maid's music.
  1102	
  1103	PUCK
  1104	                              I remember.
  1105	
  1106	OBERON
  1107	That very time I saw,--but thou couldst not,--
  1108	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
  1109	Cupid, all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  1110	At a fair vestal, throned by the west;
  1111	And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
  1112	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
  1113	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
  1114	Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
  1115	And the imperial votaress passed on,
  1116	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
  1117	Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
  1118	It fell upon a little western flower,--
  1119	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--
  1120	And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
  1121	Fetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:
  1122	The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
  1123	Will make or man or woman madly dote
  1124	Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  1125	Fetch me this herb: and be thou here again
  1126	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
  1127	
  1128	PUCK
  1129	I'll put a girdle round about the earth
  1130	In forty minutes.
  1131	
  1132	[Exit PUCK.]
  1133	
  1134	OBERON
  1135	                  Having once this juice,
  1136	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
  1137	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
  1138	The next thing then she waking looks upon,--
  1139	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
  1140	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,--
  1141	She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
  1142	And ere I take this charm from off her sight,--
  1143	As I can take it with another herb,
  1144	I'll make her render up her page to me.
  1145	But who comes here? I am invisible;
  1146	And I will overhear their conference.
  1147	
  1148	[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA following him.]
  1149	
  1150	DEMETRIUS
  1151	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
  1152	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
  1153	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
  1154	Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood,
  1155	And here am I, and wode within this wood,
  1156	Because I cannot meet with Hermia.
  1157	Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
  1158	
  1159	HELENA
  1160	You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
  1161	But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
  1162	Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,
  1163	And I shall have no power to follow you.
  1164	
  1165	DEMETRIUS
  1166	Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
  1167	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
  1168	Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
  1169	
  1170	HELENA
  1171	And even for that do I love you the more.
  1172	I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
  1173	The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
  1174	Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
  1175	Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
  1176	Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
  1177	What worser place can I beg in your love,
  1178	And yet a place of high respect with me,--
  1179	Than to be used as you use your dog?
  1180	
  1181	DEMETRIUS
  1182	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
  1183	For I am sick when I do look on thee.
  1184	
  1185	HELENA
  1186	And I am sick when I look not on you.
  1187	
  1188	DEMETRIUS
  1189	You do impeach your modesty too much,
  1190	To leave the city, and commit yourself
  1191	Into the hands of one that loves you not;
  1192	To trust the opportunity of night,
  1193	And the ill counsel of a desert place,
  1194	With the rich worth of your virginity.
  1195	
  1196	HELENA
  1197	Your virtue is my privilege for that.
  1198	It is not night when I do see your face,
  1199	Therefore I think I am not in the night;
  1200	Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company;
  1201	For you, in my respect, are all the world:
  1202	Then how can it be said I am alone
  1203	When all the world is here to look on me?
  1204	
  1205	DEMETRIUS
  1206	I'll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
  1207	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
  1208	
  1209	HELENA
  1210	The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
  1211	Run when you will, the story shall be chang'd;
  1212	Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
  1213	The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
  1214	Makes speed to catch the tiger,--bootless speed,
  1215	When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
  1216	
  1217	DEMETRIUS
  1218	I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
  1219	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
  1220	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
  1221	
  1222	HELENA
  1223	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
  1224	You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
  1225	Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  1226	We cannot fight for love as men may do:
  1227	We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
  1228	I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
  1229	To die upon the hand I love so well.
  1230	
  1231	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and HELENA.]
  1232	
  1233	OBERON
  1234	Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
  1235	Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.--
  1236	
  1237	[Re-enter PUCK.]
  1238	
  1239	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
  1240	
  1241	PUCK
  1242	Ay, there it is.
  1243	
  1244	OBERON
  1245	                 I pray thee give it me.
  1246	I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,
  1247	Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows;
  1248	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
  1249	With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine:
  1250	There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
  1251	Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight;
  1252	And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
  1253	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
  1254	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
  1255	And make her full of hateful fantasies.
  1256	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
  1257	A sweet Athenian lady is in love
  1258	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
  1259	But do it when the next thing he espies
  1260	May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
  1261	By the Athenian garments he hath on.
  1262	Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  1263	More fond on her than she upon her love:
  1264	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
  1265	
  1266	PUCK
  1267	Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so.
  1268	
  1269	[Exeunt.]
  1270	
  1271	
  1272	
  1273	SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
  1274	
  1275	[Enter TITANIA, with her Train.]
  1276	
  1277	TITANIA
  1278	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  1279	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
  1280	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
  1281	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
  1282	To make my small elves coats; and some keep back
  1283	The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders
  1284	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
  1285	Then to your offices, and let me rest.
  1286	
  1287	      SONG.
  1288	        I.
  1289	FIRST FAIRY
  1290	   You spotted snakes, with double tongue,
  1291	     Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
  1292	   Newts and blind-worms do no wrong;
  1293	     Come not near our fairy queen:
  1294	
  1295	     CHORUS.
  1296	   Philomel, with melody,
  1297	   Sing in our sweet lullaby:
  1298	Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:
  1299	   Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
  1300	   Come our lovely lady nigh;
  1301	   So good-night, with lullaby.
  1302	
  1303	        II.
  1304	SECOND FAIRY
  1305	   Weaving spiders, come not here;
  1306	     Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence;
  1307	   Beetles black, approach not near;
  1308	     Worm nor snail do no offence.
  1309	
  1310	    CHORUS
  1311	Philomel with melody, &c.
  1312	
  1313	
  1314	FIRST FAIRY
  1315	Hence away; now all is well.
  1316	One, aloof, stand sentinel.
  1317	
  1318	[Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps.]
  1319	
  1320	[Enter OBERON.]
  1321	
  1322	OBERON
  1323	What thou seest when thou dost wake,
  1324	[Squeezes the flower on TITANIA'S eyelids.]
  1325	Do it for thy true-love take;
  1326	Love and languish for his sake;
  1327	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
  1328	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
  1329	In thy eye that shall appear
  1330	When thou wak'st, it is thy dear;
  1331	Wake when some vile thing is near.
  1332	
  1333	[Exit.]
  1334	
  1335	[Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA.]
  1336	
  1337	LYSANDER
  1338	Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
  1339	  And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
  1340	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
  1341	  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
  1342	
  1343	HERMIA
  1344	Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,
  1345	For I upon this bank will rest my head.
  1346	
  1347	LYSANDER
  1348	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
  1349	One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
  1350	
  1351	HERMIA
  1352	Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
  1353	Lie farther off yet, do not lie so near.
  1354	
  1355	LYSANDER
  1356	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence;
  1357	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
  1358	I mean that my heart unto yours is knit;
  1359	So that but one heart we can make of it:
  1360	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
  1361	So then two bosoms and a single troth.
  1362	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
  1363	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
  1364	
  1365	HERMIA
  1366	Lysander riddles very prettily:--
  1367	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
  1368	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
  1369	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
  1370	Lie further off; in human modesty,
  1371	Such separation as may well be said
  1372	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid:
  1373	So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:
  1374	Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
  1375	
  1376	LYSANDER
  1377	Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;
  1378	And then end life when I end loyalty!
  1379	Here is my bed: Sleep give thee all his rest!
  1380	
  1381	HERMIA
  1382	With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed!
  1383	
  1384	[They sleep.]
  1385	
  1386	[Enter PUCK.]
  1387	
  1388	PUCK
  1389	  Through the forest have I gone,
  1390	  But Athenian found I none,
  1391	  On whose eyes I might approve
  1392	  This flower's force in stirring love.
  1393	  Night and silence! Who is here?
  1394	  Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
  1395	  This is he, my master said,
  1396	  Despised the Athenian maid;
  1397	  And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
  1398	  On the dank and dirty ground.
  1399	  Pretty soul! she durst not lie
  1400	  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
  1401	  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
  1402	  All the power this charm doth owe;
  1403	  When thou wak'st let love forbid
  1404	  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
  1405	  So awake when I am gone;
  1406	  For I must now to Oberon.
  1407	
  1408	[Exit.]
  1409	
  1410	[Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running.]
  1411	
  1412	HELENA
  1413	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
  1414	
  1415	DEMETRIUS
  1416	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
  1417	
  1418	HELENA
  1419	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
  1420	
  1421	DEMETRIUS.
  1422	Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.
  1423	
  1424	[Exit DEMETRIUS.]
  1425	
  1426	HELENA
  1427	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
  1428	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
  1429	Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies,
  1430	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
  1431	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
  1432	If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
  1433	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
  1434	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
  1435	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
  1436	Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
  1437	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
  1438	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?--
  1439	But who is here?--Lysander! on the ground!
  1440	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  1441	Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
  1442	
  1443	LYSANDER
  1444	[Waking.]
  1445	And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
  1446	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
  1447	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
  1448	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
  1449	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
  1450	
  1451	HELENA
  1452	Do not say so, Lysander; say not so:
  1453	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
  1454	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
  1455	
  1456	LYSANDER.
  1457	Content with Hermia? No: I do repent
  1458	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
  1459	Not Hermia but Helena I love:
  1460	Who will not change a raven for a dove?
  1461	The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
  1462	And reason says you are the worthier maid.
  1463	Things growing are not ripe until their season;
  1464	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
  1465	And touching now the point of human skill,
  1466	Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
  1467	And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
  1468	Love's stories, written in love's richest book.
  1469	
  1470	HELENA
  1471	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
  1472	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
  1473	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
  1474	That I did never, no, nor never can
  1475	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
  1476	But you must flout my insufficiency?
  1477	Good troth, you do me wrong,--good sooth, you do--
  1478	In such disdainful manner me to woo.
  1479	But fare you well: perforce I must confess,
  1480	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
  1481	O, that a lady of one man refus'd
  1482	Should of another therefore be abus'd!
  1483	
  1484	[Exit.]
  1485	
  1486	LYSANDER
  1487	She sees not Hermia:--Hermia, sleep thou there;
  1488	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
  1489	For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things
  1490	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings;
  1491	Or, as the heresies that men do leave
  1492	Are hated most of those they did deceive;
  1493	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
  1494	Of all be hated, but the most of me!
  1495	And, all my powers, address your love and might
  1496	To honour Helen, and to be her knight!
  1497	
  1498	[Exit.]
  1499	
  1500	HERMIA
  1501	[Starting.]
  1502	Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
  1503	To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
  1504	Ay me, for pity!--What a dream was here!
  1505	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear!
  1506	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
  1507	And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.--
  1508	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
  1509	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
  1510	Alack, where are you? speak, an if you hear;
  1511	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
  1512	No?--then I well perceive you are not nigh:
  1513	Either death or you I'll find immediately.
  1514	
  1515	[Exit.]
  1516	
  1517	
  1518	ACT III.
  1519	
  1520	SCENE I. The Wood. The Queen of Fairies lying asleep.
  1521	
  1522	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING.]
  1523	
  1524	BOTTOM
  1525	Are we all met?
  1526	
  1527	QUINCE
  1528	Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our
  1529	rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn
  1530	brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will
  1531	do it before the duke.
  1532	
  1533	BOTTOM
  1534	Peter Quince,--
  1535	
  1536	QUINCE
  1537	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
  1538	
  1539	BOTTOM
  1540	There are things in this comedy of 'Pyramus and Thisby' that
  1541	will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill
  1542	himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
  1543	
  1544	SNOUT
  1545	By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
  1546	
  1547	STARVELING
  1548	I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
  1549	
  1550	BOTTOM
  1551	Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a
  1552	prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
  1553	with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for
  1554	the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not
  1555	Pyramus but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.
  1556	
  1557	QUINCE
  1558	Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
  1559	written in eight and six.
  1560	
  1561	BOTTOM
  1562	No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
  1563	
  1564	SNOUT
  1565	Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
  1566	
  1567	STARVELING
  1568	I fear it, I promise you.
  1569	
  1570	BOTTOM
  1571	Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in,
  1572	God shield us! a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing:
  1573	for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living;
  1574	and we ought to look to it.
  1575	
  1576	SNOUT
  1577	Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
  1578	
  1579	BOTTOM
  1580	Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen
  1581	through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,
  1582	saying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,' or, 'Fair ladies, I
  1583	would wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you,
  1584	not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I
  1585	come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such
  1586	thing; I am a man as other men are:'--and there, indeed, let him
  1587	name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
  1588	
  1589	QUINCE
  1590	Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things; that
  1591	is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber: for, you know,
  1592	Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
  1593	
  1594	SNOUT
  1595	Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
  1596	
  1597	BOTTOM
  1598	A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out
  1599	moonshine, find out moonshine.
  1600	
  1601	QUINCE
  1602	Yes, it doth shine that night.
  1603	
  1604	BOTTOM
  1605	Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window,
  1606	where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.
  1607	
  1608	QUINCE
  1609	Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
  1610	lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person
  1611	of moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a
  1612	wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the
  1613	story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
  1614	
  1615	SNOUT
  1616	You can never bring in a wall.--What say you, Bottom?
  1617	
  1618	BOTTOM
  1619	Some man or other must present wall: and let him have
  1620	some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to
  1621	signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that
  1622	cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
  1623	
  1624	QUINCE
  1625	If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every
  1626	mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin:
  1627	when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so
  1628	every one according to his cue.
  1629	
  1630	[Enter PUCK behind.]
  1631	
  1632	PUCK
  1633	What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,
  1634	So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
  1635	What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
  1636	An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
  1637	
  1638	QUINCE
  1639	Speak, Pyramus.--Thisby, stand forth.
  1640	
  1641	PYRAMUS
  1642	  'Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,'
  1643	
  1644	QUINCE
  1645	Odours, odours.
  1646	
  1647	PYRAMUS
  1648	  '--odours savours sweet:
  1649	  So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.--
  1650	But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
  1651	  And by and by I will to thee appear.'
  1652	
  1653	[Exit.]
  1654	
  1655	PUCK
  1656	A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here!
  1657	
  1658	[Aside.--Exit.]
  1659	
  1660	THISBE
  1661	Must I speak now?
  1662	
  1663	QUINCE
  1664	Ay, marry, must you: for you must understand he goes
  1665	but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
  1666	
  1667	THISBE
  1668	  'Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue,
  1669	  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
  1670	Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
  1671	  As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
  1672	I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.'
  1673	
  1674	QUINCE
  1675	Ninus' tomb, man: why, you must not speak that yet:
  1676	that you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once,
  1677	cues, and all.--Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is 'never
  1678	tire.'
  1679	
  1680	[Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head.]
  1681	
  1682	THISBE
  1683	O,'--As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.'
  1684	
  1685	PYRAMUS
  1686	'If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine:--'
  1687	
  1688	QUINCE
  1689	O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray, masters!
  1690	fly, masters! Help!
  1691	
  1692	[Exeunt Clowns.]
  1693	
  1694	PUCK
  1695	I'll follow you; I'll lead you about a round,
  1696	  Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;
  1697	Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
  1698	  A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
  1699	And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
  1700	Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
  1701	
  1702	[Exit.]
  1703	
  1704	BOTTOM
  1705	Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make
  1706	me afeard.
  1707	
  1708	[Re-enter SNOUT.]
  1709	
  1710	SNOUT
  1711	O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?
  1712	
  1713	BOTTOM
  1714	What do you see? you see an ass-head of your own, do you?
  1715	
  1716	[Re-enter QUINCE.]
  1717	
  1718	QUINCE
  1719	Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art translated.
  1720	
  1721	[Exit.]
  1722	
  1723	BOTTOM
  1724	I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to
  1725	fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this
  1726	place, do what they can: I will walk up and down here,
  1727	and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
  1728	
  1729	[Sings.]
  1730	
  1731	   The ousel cock, so black of hue,
  1732	     With orange-tawny bill,
  1733	   The throstle with his note so true,
  1734	     The wren with little quill.
  1735	
  1736	TITANIA
  1737	[Waking.]
  1738	What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
  1739	
  1740	BOTTOM
  1741	[Sings.]
  1742	   The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,
  1743	     The plain-song cuckoo gray,
  1744	   Whose note full many a man doth mark,
  1745	     And dares not answer nay;--
  1746	for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
  1747	Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so?
  1748	
  1749	TITANIA
  1750	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again;
  1751	Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note.
  1752	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
  1753	And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
  1754	On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
  1755	
  1756	BOTTOM
  1757	Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for
  1758	that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little
  1759	company together now-a-days: the more the pity that some honest
  1760	neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon
  1761	occasion.
  1762	
  1763	TITANIA
  1764	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
  1765	
  1766	BOTTOM
  1767	Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of
  1768	this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
  1769	
  1770	TITANIA
  1771	Out of this wood do not desire to go;
  1772	Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.
  1773	I am a spirit of no common rate,--
  1774	The summer still doth tend upon my state;
  1775	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me,
  1776	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
  1777	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
  1778	And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep:
  1779	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
  1780	That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.--
  1781	Peasblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
  1782	
  1783	[Enter Four Fairies.]
  1784	
  1785	FIRST FAIRY
  1786	Ready.
  1787	
  1788	SECOND FAIRY
  1789	     And I.
  1790	
  1791	THIRD FAIRY
  1792	          And I.
  1793	
  1794	FOURTH FAIRY
  1795	               Where shall we go?
  1796	
  1797	TITANIA
  1798	Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
  1799	Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
  1800	Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
  1801	With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
  1802	The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,
  1803	And, for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,
  1804	And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
  1805	To have my love to bed and to arise;
  1806	And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
  1807	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
  1808	Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
  1809	
  1810	FIRST FAIRY
  1811	Hail, mortal!
  1812	
  1813	SECOND FAIRY
  1814	Hail!
  1815	
  1816	THIRD FAIRY
  1817	Hail!
  1818	
  1819	FOURTH FAIRY
  1820	Hail!
  1821	
  1822	BOTTOM
  1823	I cry your worships mercy, heartily.--I beseech your
  1824	worship's name.
  1825	
  1826	COBWEB
  1827	Cobweb.
  1828	
  1829	BOTTOM
  1830	I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb. If I
  1831	cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.--Your name, honest
  1832	gentleman?
  1833	
  1834	PEASBLOSSOM
  1835	Peasblossom.
  1836	
  1837	BOTTOM
  1838	I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and
  1839	to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peasblossom, I
  1840	shall desire you of more acquaintance too.--Your name, I beseech
  1841	you, sir?
  1842	
  1843	MUSTARDSEED
  1844	Mustardseed.
  1845	
  1846	BOTTOM
  1847	Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
  1848	That same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a
  1849	gentleman of your house: I promise you your kindred hath made my
  1850	eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good
  1851	Master Mustardseed.
  1852	
  1853	TITANIA
  1854	  Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
  1855	  The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye;
  1856	And when she weeps, weeps every little flower;
  1857	  Lamenting some enforc&egrave;d chastity.
  1858	  Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
  1859	
  1860	[Exeunt.]
  1861	
  1862	
  1863	
  1864	SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
  1865	
  1866	[Enter OBERON.]
  1867	
  1868	OBERON
  1869	I wonder if Titania be awak'd;
  1870	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
  1871	Which she must dote on in extremity.
  1872	
  1873	[Enter PUCK.]
  1874	
  1875	Here comes my messenger.--How now, mad spirit?
  1876	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
  1877	
  1878	PUCK
  1879	My mistress with a monster is in love.
  1880	Near to her close and consecrated bower,
  1881	While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
  1882	A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
  1883	That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
  1884	Were met together to rehearse a play
  1885	Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day.
  1886	The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
  1887	Who Pyramus presented in their sport,
  1888	Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake;
  1889	When I did him at this advantage take,
  1890	An ass's nowl I fix&egrave;d on his head;
  1891	Anon, his Thisbe must be answered,
  1892	And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
  1893	As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
  1894	Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  1895	Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  1896	Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
  1897	So at his sight away his fellows fly:
  1898	And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;
  1899	He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.
  1900	Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears, thus strong,
  1901	Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
  1902	For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
  1903	Some sleeves, some hats: from yielders all things catch.
  1904	I led them on in this distracted fear,
  1905	And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
  1906	When in that moment,--so it came to pass,--
  1907	Titania wak'd, and straightway lov'd an ass.
  1908	
  1909	OBERON
  1910	This falls out better than I could devise.
  1911	But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
  1912	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
  1913	
  1914	PUCK
  1915	I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
  1916	And the Athenian woman by his side;
  1917	That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd.
  1918	
  1919	[Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA.]
  1920	
  1921	OBERON
  1922	Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
  1923	
  1924	PUCK
  1925	This is the woman, but not this the man.
  1926	
  1927	DEMETRIUS
  1928	O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
  1929	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
  1930	
  1931	HERMIA
  1932	Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse;
  1933	For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
  1934	If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
  1935	Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
  1936	And kill me too.
  1937	The sun was not so true unto the day
  1938	As he to me: would he have stol'n away
  1939	From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
  1940	This whole earth may be bor'd; and that the moon
  1941	May through the centre creep and so displease
  1942	Her brother's noontide with the antipodes.
  1943	It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
  1944	So should a murderer look; so dead, so grim.
  1945	
  1946	DEMETRIUS
  1947	So should the murder'd look; and so should I,
  1948	Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty:
  1949	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
  1950	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
  1951	
  1952	HERMIA
  1953	What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
  1954	Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
  1955	
  1956	DEMETRIUS
  1957	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
  1958	
  1959	HERMIA
  1960	Out, dog! out, cur! thou driv'st me past the bounds
  1961	Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
  1962	Henceforth be never number'd among men!
  1963	Oh! once tell true; tell true, even for my sake;
  1964	Durst thou have look'd upon him, being awake,
  1965	And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
  1966	Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
  1967	An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
  1968	Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
  1969	
  1970	DEMETRIUS
  1971	You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
  1972	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
  1973	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
  1974	
  1975	HERMIA
  1976	I pray thee, tell me, then, that he is well.
  1977	
  1978	DEMETRIUS
  1979	An if I could, what should I get therefore?
  1980	
  1981	HERMIA
  1982	A privilege never to see me more.--
  1983	And from thy hated presence part I so:
  1984	See me no more whether he be dead or no.
  1985	
  1986	[Exit.]
  1987	
  1988	DEMETRIUS
  1989	There is no following her in this fierce vein:
  1990	Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.
  1991	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
  1992	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
  1993	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
  1994	If for his tender here I make some stay.
  1995	
  1996	[Lies down.]
  1997	
  1998	OBERON
  1999	What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,
  2000	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
  2001	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
  2002	Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
  2003	
  2004	PUCK
  2005	Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
  2006	A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
  2007	
  2008	OBERON
  2009	About the wood go, swifter than the wind,
  2010	And Helena of Athens look thou find:
  2011	All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer,
  2012	With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
  2013	By some illusion see thou bring her here;
  2014	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
  2015	
  2016	PUCK
  2017	I go, I go; look how I go,--
  2018	Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
  2019	
  2020	[Exit.]
  2021	
  2022	OBERON
  2023	  Flower of this purple dye,
  2024	  Hit with Cupid's archery,
  2025	  Sink in apple of his eye!
  2026	  When his love he doth espy,
  2027	  Let her shine as gloriously
  2028	  As the Venus of the sky.--
  2029	  When thou wak'st, if she be by,
  2030	  Beg of her for remedy.
  2031	
  2032	[Re-enter PUCK.]
  2033	
  2034	PUCK
  2035	  Captain of our fairy band,
  2036	  Helena is here at hand,
  2037	  And the youth mistook by me
  2038	  Pleading for a lover's fee;
  2039	  Shall we their fond pageant see?
  2040	  Lord, what fools these mortals be!
  2041	
  2042	OBERON
  2043	  Stand aside: the noise they make
  2044	  Will cause Demetrius to awake.
  2045	
  2046	PUCK
  2047	  Then will two at once woo one,--
  2048	  That must needs be sport alone;
  2049	  And those things do best please me
  2050	  That befall preposterously.
  2051	
  2052	[Enter LYSANDER and HELENA.]
  2053	
  2054	LYSANDER
  2055	Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
  2056	  Scorn and derision never come in tears.
  2057	Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
  2058	  In their nativity all truth appears.
  2059	How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
  2060	Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
  2061	
  2062	HELENA
  2063	You do advance your cunning more and more.
  2064	  When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
  2065	These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
  2066	  Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
  2067	Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
  2068	Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.
  2069	
  2070	LYSANDER
  2071	I had no judgment when to her I swore.
  2072	
  2073	HELENA
  2074	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
  2075	
  2076	LYSANDER
  2077	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
  2078	
  2079	DEMETRIUS
  2080	[Awaking.]
  2081	O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
  2082	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
  2083	Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
  2084	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
  2085	That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,
  2086	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
  2087	When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
  2088	This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  2089	
  2090	HELENA
  2091	O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
  2092	To set against me for your merriment.
  2093	If you were civil, and knew courtesy,
  2094	You would not do me thus much injury.
  2095	Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
  2096	But you must join in souls to mock me too?
  2097	If you were men, as men you are in show,
  2098	You would not use a gentle lady so;
  2099	To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
  2100	When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
  2101	You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
  2102	And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
  2103	A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
  2104	To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
  2105	With your derision! None of noble sort
  2106	Would so offend a virgin, and extort
  2107	A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
  2108	
  2109	LYSANDER
  2110	You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
  2111	For you love Hermia: this you know I know:
  2112	And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
  2113	In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
  2114	And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
  2115	Whom I do love and will do till my death.
  2116	
  2117	HELENA
  2118	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  2119	
  2120	DEMETRIUS
  2121	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
  2122	If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
  2123	My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd;
  2124	And now to Helen is it home return'd,
  2125	There to remain.
  2126	
  2127	LYSANDER
  2128	                 Helen, it is not so.
  2129	
  2130	DEMETRIUS
  2131	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
  2132	Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.--
  2133	Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
  2134	
  2135	[Enter HERMIA.]
  2136	
  2137	HERMIA
  2138	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  2139	The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
  2140	Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
  2141	It pays the hearing double recompense:--
  2142	Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
  2143	Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
  2144	But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
  2145	
  2146	LYSANDER
  2147	Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  2148	
  2149	HERMIA
  2150	What love could press Lysander from my side?
  2151	
  2152	LYSANDER
  2153	Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,--
  2154	Fair Helena,--who more engilds the night
  2155	Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
  2156	Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know
  2157	The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
  2158	
  2159	HERMIA
  2160	You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
  2161	
  2162	HELENA
  2163	Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
  2164	Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
  2165	To fashion this false sport in spite of me.
  2166	Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
  2167	Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,
  2168	To bait me with this foul derision?
  2169	Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
  2170	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
  2171	When we have chid the hasty-footed time
  2172	For parting us,--O, is all forgot?
  2173	All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
  2174	We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
  2175	Have with our needles created both one flower,
  2176	Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
  2177	Both warbling of one song, both in one key;
  2178	As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,
  2179	Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
  2180	Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;
  2181	But yet a union in partition,
  2182	Two lovely berries moulded on one stem:
  2183	So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
  2184	Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
  2185	Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
  2186	And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
  2187	To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
  2188	It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
  2189	Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
  2190	Though I alone do feel the injury.
  2191	
  2192	HERMIA
  2193	I am amazed at your passionate words:
  2194	I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.
  2195	
  2196	HELENA
  2197	Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  2198	To follow me, and praise my eyes and face?
  2199	And made your other love, Demetrius,--
  2200	Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,--
  2201	To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
  2202	Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
  2203	To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
  2204	Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
  2205	And tender me, forsooth, affection,
  2206	But by your setting on, by your consent?
  2207	What though I be not so in grace as you,
  2208	So hung upon with love, so fortunate;
  2209	But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
  2210	This you should pity rather than despise.
  2211	
  2212	HERMIA
  2213	I understand not what you mean by this.
  2214	
  2215	HELENA
  2216	Ay, do persever, counterfeit sad looks,
  2217	Make mows upon me when I turn my back;
  2218	Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
  2219	This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
  2220	If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
  2221	You would not make me such an argument.
  2222	But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
  2223	Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.
  2224	
  2225	LYSANDER
  2226	Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
  2227	My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
  2228	
  2229	HELENA
  2230	O excellent!
  2231	
  2232	HERMIA
  2233	             Sweet, do not scorn her so.
  2234	
  2235	DEMETRIUS
  2236	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
  2237	
  2238	LYSANDER
  2239	Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
  2240	Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.--
  2241	Helen, I love thee; by my life I do;
  2242	I swear by that which I will lose for thee
  2243	To prove him false that says I love thee not.
  2244	
  2245	DEMETRIUS
  2246	I say I love thee more than he can do.
  2247	
  2248	LYSANDER
  2249	If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
  2250	
  2251	DEMETRIUS
  2252	Quick, come,--
  2253	
  2254	HERMIA
  2255	               Lysander, whereto tends all this?
  2256	
  2257	LYSANDER
  2258	Away, you Ethiope!
  2259	
  2260	DEMETRIUS
  2261	                   No, no, sir:--he will
  2262	Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow:
  2263	But yet come not. You are a tame man; go!
  2264	
  2265	LYSANDER
  2266	Hang off, thou cat, thou burr: vile thing, let loose,
  2267	Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
  2268	
  2269	HERMIA
  2270	Why are you grown so rude? what change is this,
  2271	Sweet love?
  2272	
  2273	LYSANDER
  2274	            Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
  2275	Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
  2276	
  2277	HERMIA
  2278	Do you not jest?
  2279	
  2280	HELENA
  2281	                 Yes, sooth; and so do you.
  2282	
  2283	LYSANDER
  2284	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
  2285	
  2286	DEMETRIUS
  2287	I would I had your bond; for I perceive
  2288	A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
  2289	
  2290	LYSANDER
  2291	What! should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
  2292	Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
  2293	
  2294	HERMIA
  2295	What! can you do me greater harm than hate?
  2296	Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
  2297	Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
  2298	I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
  2299	Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me:
  2300	Why then, you left me,--O, the gods forbid!--
  2301	In earnest, shall I say?
  2302	
  2303	LYSANDER
  2304	                         Ay, by my life;
  2305	And never did desire to see thee more.
  2306	Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt,
  2307	Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
  2308	That I do hate thee and love Helena.
  2309	
  2310	HERMIA
  2311	O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
  2312	You thief of love! What! have you come by night,
  2313	And stol'n my love's heart from him?
  2314	
  2315	HELENA
  2316	                                     Fine, i' faith!
  2317	Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
  2318	No touch of bashfulness? What! will you tear
  2319	Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
  2320	Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
  2321	
  2322	HERMIA
  2323	Puppet! why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
  2324	Now I perceive that she hath made compare
  2325	Between our statures; she hath urg'd her height;
  2326	And with her personage, her tall personage,
  2327	Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.--
  2328	And are you grown so high in his esteem
  2329	Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
  2330	How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
  2331	How low am I? I am not yet so low
  2332	But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
  2333	
  2334	HELENA
  2335	I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
  2336	Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;
  2337	I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
  2338	I am a right maid for my cowardice;
  2339	Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
  2340	Because she is something lower than myself,
  2341	That I can match her.
  2342	
  2343	HERMIA
  2344	                      Lower! hark, again.
  2345	
  2346	HELENA
  2347	Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
  2348	I evermore did love you, Hermia;
  2349	Did ever keep your counsels; never wrong'd you;
  2350	Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
  2351	I told him of your stealth unto this wood:
  2352	He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
  2353	But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me
  2354	To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
  2355	And now, so you will let me quiet go,
  2356	To Athens will I bear my folly back,
  2357	And follow you no farther. Let me go:
  2358	You see how simple and how fond I am.
  2359	
  2360	HERMIA
  2361	Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
  2362	
  2363	HELENA
  2364	A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
  2365	
  2366	HERMIA
  2367	What! with Lysander?
  2368	
  2369	HELENA
  2370	                     With Demetrius.
  2371	
  2372	LYSANDER
  2373	Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
  2374	
  2375	DEMETRIUS
  2376	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  2377	
  2378	HELENA
  2379	O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd:
  2380	She was a vixen when she went to school;
  2381	And, though she be but little, she is fierce.
  2382	
  2383	HERMIA
  2384	Little again! nothing but low and little!--
  2385	Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
  2386	Let me come to her.
  2387	
  2388	LYSANDER
  2389	                    Get you gone, you dwarf;
  2390	You minimus, of hind'ring knot-grass made;
  2391	You bead, you acorn.
  2392	
  2393	DEMETRIUS
  2394	                     You are too officious
  2395	In her behalf that scorns your services.
  2396	Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
  2397	Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
  2398	Never so little show of love to her,
  2399	Thou shalt aby it.
  2400	
  2401	LYSANDER
  2402	                   Now she holds me not;
  2403	Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
  2404	Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
  2405	
  2406	DEMETRIUS
  2407	Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
  2408	
  2409	[Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS.]
  2410	
  2411	HERMIA
  2412	You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
  2413	Nay, go not back.
  2414	
  2415	HELENA
  2416	                  I will not trust you, I;
  2417	Nor longer stay in your curst company.
  2418	Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
  2419	My legs are longer though, to run away.
  2420	
  2421	[Exit.]
  2422	
  2423	HERMIA
  2424	I am amaz'd, and know not what to say.
  2425	
  2426	[Exit, pursuing HELENA.]
  2427	
  2428	OBERON
  2429	This is thy negligence: still thou mistak'st,
  2430	Or else commit'st thy knaveries willfully.
  2431	
  2432	PUCK
  2433	Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
  2434	Did not you tell me I should know the man
  2435	By the Athenian garments he had on?
  2436	And so far blameless proves my enterprise
  2437	That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes:
  2438	And so far am I glad it so did sort,
  2439	As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
  2440	
  2441	OBERON
  2442	Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
  2443	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
  2444	The starry welkin cover thou anon
  2445	With drooping fog, as black as Acheron,
  2446	And lead these testy rivals so astray
  2447	As one come not within another's way.
  2448	Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
  2449	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
  2450	And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
  2451	And from each other look thou lead them thus,
  2452	Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
  2453	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
  2454	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
  2455	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
  2456	To take from thence all error with his might
  2457	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
  2458	When they next wake, all this derision
  2459	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
  2460	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
  2461	With league whose date till death shall never end.
  2462	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
  2463	I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
  2464	And then I will her charmed eye release
  2465	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
  2466	
  2467	PUCK
  2468	My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
  2469	For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
  2470	And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,
  2471	At whose approach ghosts, wandering here and there,
  2472	Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
  2473	That in cross-ways and floods have burial,
  2474	Already to their wormy beds are gone;
  2475	For fear lest day should look their shames upon
  2476	They wilfully exile themselves from light,
  2477	And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
  2478	
  2479	OBERON
  2480	But we are spirits of another sort:
  2481	I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
  2482	And, like a forester, the groves may tread
  2483	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
  2484	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  2485	Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
  2486	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
  2487	We may effect this business yet ere day.
  2488	
  2489	[Exit OBERON.]
  2490	
  2491	PUCK
  2492	  Up and down, up and down;
  2493	  I will lead them up and down:
  2494	  I am fear'd in field and town.
  2495	  Goblin, lead them up and down.
  2496	Here comes one.
  2497	
  2498	[Enter LYSANDER.]
  2499	
  2500	LYSANDER
  2501	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
  2502	
  2503	PUCK
  2504	Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  2505	
  2506	LYSANDER
  2507	I will be with thee straight.
  2508	
  2509	PUCK
  2510	                              Follow me, then,
  2511	To plainer ground.
  2512	
  2513	[Exit LYSANDER as following the voice.]
  2514	
  2515	[Enter DEMETRIUS.]
  2516	
  2517	DEMETRIUS
  2518	                   Lysander! speak again.
  2519	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
  2520	Speak. In some bush? where dost thou hide thy head?
  2521	
  2522	PUCK
  2523	Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
  2524	Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
  2525	And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
  2526	I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
  2527	That draws a sword on thee.
  2528	
  2529	DEMETRIUS
  2530	                            Yea, art thou there?
  2531	
  2532	PUCK
  2533	Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
  2534	
  2535	[Exeunt.]
  2536	
  2537	[Re-enter LYSANDER.]
  2538	
  2539	LYSANDER
  2540	He goes before me, and still dares me on;
  2541	When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
  2542	The villain is much lighter heeled than I:
  2543	I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
  2544	That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
  2545	And here will rest me.  Come, thou gentle day!
  2546	[Lies down.]
  2547	For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
  2548	I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.
  2549	
  2550	[Sleeps.]
  2551	
  2552	[Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS.]
  2553	
  2554	PUCK
  2555	Ho, ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?
  2556	
  2557	DEMETRIUS
  2558	Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot
  2559	Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place;
  2560	And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
  2561	Where art thou?
  2562	
  2563	PUCK
  2564	                Come hither; I am here.
  2565	
  2566	DEMETRIUS
  2567	Nay, then, thou mock'st me.
  2568	Thou shalt buy this dear,
  2569	If ever I thy face by daylight see:
  2570	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
  2571	To measure out my length on this cold bed.--
  2572	By day's approach look to be visited.
  2573	
  2574	[Lies down and sleeps.]
  2575	
  2576	[Enter HELENA.]
  2577	
  2578	HELENA
  2579	O weary night, O long and tedious night,
  2580	Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,
  2581	That I may back to Athens by daylight,
  2582	From these that my poor company detest:--
  2583	And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
  2584	Steal me awhile from mine own company.
  2585	
  2586	[Sleeps.]
  2587	
  2588	PUCK
  2589	  Yet but three? Come one more;
  2590	  Two of both kinds makes up four.
  2591	  Here she comes, curst and sad:--
  2592	  Cupid is a knavish lad,
  2593	  Thus to make poor females mad.
  2594	
  2595	[Enter HERMIA.]
  2596	
  2597	HERMIA
  2598	Never so weary, never so in woe,
  2599	  Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers;
  2600	I can no further crawl, no further go;
  2601	  My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
  2602	Here will I rest me till the break of day.
  2603	Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
  2604	
  2605	[Lies down.]
  2606	
  2607	PUCK
  2608	  On the ground
  2609	  Sleep sound:
  2610	  I'll apply
  2611	  To your eye,
  2612	  Gentle lover, remedy.
  2613	
  2614	[Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER'S eye.]
  2615	
  2616	  When thou wak'st,
  2617	  Thou tak'st
  2618	  True delight
  2619	  In the sight
  2620	Of thy former lady's eye:
  2621	And the country proverb known,
  2622	That every man should take his own,
  2623	In your waking shall be shown:
  2624	  Jack shall have Jill;
  2625	  Nought shall go ill;
  2626	The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
  2627

  2632	ACT IV
  2633	
  2634	SCENE I. The Wood.
  2635	
  2636	[Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,
  2637	MUSTARDSEED, and other FAIRIES attending; OBERON behind, unseen.]
  2638	
  2639	TITANIA
  2640	Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
  2641	  While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
  2642	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
  2643	  And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
  2644	
  2645	BOTTOM
  2646	Where's Peasblossom?
  2647	
  2648	PEASBLOSSOM
  2649	Ready.
  2650	
  2651	BOTTOM
  2652	Scratch my head, Peasblossom.--
  2653	Where's Monsieur Cobweb?
  2654	
  2655	COBWEB
  2656	Ready.
  2657	
  2658	BOTTOM
  2659	Monsieur Cobweb; good monsieur, get you your weapons in
  2660	your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a
  2661	thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not
  2662	fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur; and, good
  2663	monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be
  2664	loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior.--
  2665	Where's Monsieur Mustardseed?
  2666	
  2667	MUSTARDSEED
  2668	Ready.
  2669	
  2670	BOTTOM
  2671	Give me your neif, Monsieur Mustardseed.
  2672	Pray you, leave your curtsy, good monsieur.
  2673	
  2674	MUSTARDSEED
  2675	What's your will?
  2676	
  2677	BOTTOM
  2678	Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalero Cobweb to
  2679	scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for methinks I am
  2680	marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass,
  2681	if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
  2682	
  2683	TITANIA
  2684	What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
  2685	
  2686	BOTTOM
  2687	I have a reasonable good ear in music; let us have the
  2688	tongs and the bones.
  2689	
  2690	TITANIA
  2691	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
  2692	
  2693	BOTTOM
  2694	Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry
  2695	oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good
  2696	hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
  2697	
  2698	TITANIA
  2699	I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
  2700	The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
  2701	
  2702	BOTTOM
  2703	I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But,
  2704	I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an
  2705	exposition of sleep come upon me.
  2706	
  2707	TITANIA
  2708	Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
  2709	Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
  2710	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
  2711	Gently entwist,--the female ivy so
  2712	Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  2713	O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
  2714	
  2715	[They sleep.]
  2716	
  2717	[OBERON advances. Enter PUCK.]
  2718	
  2719	OBERON
  2720	Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?
  2721	Her dotage now I do begin to pity.
  2722	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
  2723	Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,
  2724	I did upbraid her and fall out with her:
  2725	For she his hairy temples then had rounded
  2726	With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
  2727	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
  2728	Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
  2729	Stood now within the pretty flow'rets' eyes,
  2730	Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  2731	When I had, at my pleasure, taunted her,
  2732	And she, in mild terms, begg'd my patience,
  2733	I then did ask of her her changeling child;
  2734	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
  2735	To bear him to my bower in fairy-land.
  2736	And now I have the boy, I will undo
  2737	This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
  2738	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
  2739	From off the head of this Athenian swain,
  2740	That he awaking when the other do,
  2741	May all to Athens back again repair,
  2742	And think no more of this night's accidents
  2743	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
  2744	But first I will release the fairy queen.
  2745	  Be as thou wast wont to be;
  2746	[Touching her eyes with an herb.]
  2747	  See as thou was wont to see.
  2748	  Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
  2749	  Hath such force and blessed power.
  2750	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
  2751	
  2752	TITANIA
  2753	My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
  2754	Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  2755	
  2756	OBERON
  2757	There lies your love.
  2758	
  2759	TITANIA
  2760	                      How came these things to pass?
  2761	O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
  2762	
  2763	OBERON
  2764	Silence awhile.--Robin, take off this head.
  2765	Titania, music call; and strike more dead
  2766	Than common sleep, of all these five, the sense.
  2767	
  2768	TITANIA
  2769	Music, ho! music; such as charmeth sleep.
  2770	
  2771	PUCK
  2772	Now when thou wak'st, with thine own fool's eyes peep.
  2773	
  2774	OBERON
  2775	Sound, music. [Still music.] Come, my queen, take hands with me,
  2776	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
  2777	Now thou and I are new in amity,
  2778	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
  2779	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
  2780	And bless it to all fair prosperity:
  2781	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
  2782	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
  2783	
  2784	PUCK
  2785	Fairy king, attend and mark;
  2786	I do hear the morning lark.
  2787	
  2788	OBERON
  2789	  Then, my queen, in silence sad,
  2790	  Trip we after night's shade.
  2791	  We the globe can compass soon,
  2792	  Swifter than the wand'ring moon.
  2793	
  2794	TITANIA
  2795	  Come, my lord; and in our flight,
  2796	  Tell me how it came this night
  2797	  That I sleeping here was found
  2798	  With these mortals on the ground.
  2799	
  2800	[Exeunt. Horns sound within.]
  2801	
  2802	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and Train.]
  2803	
  2804	THESEUS
  2805	Go, one of you, find out the forester;--
  2806	For now our observation is perform'd;
  2807	And since we have the vaward of the day,
  2808	My love shall hear the music of my hounds,--
  2809	Uncouple in the western valley; go:--
  2810	Despatch, I say, and find the forester.--
  2811	
  2812	[Exit an ATTENDANT.]
  2813	
  2814	We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
  2815	And mark the musical confusion
  2816	Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
  2817	
  2818	HIPPOLYTA
  2819	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
  2820	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
  2821	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
  2822	Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,
  2823	The skies, the fountains, every region near
  2824	Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
  2825	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
  2826	
  2827	THESEUS
  2828	My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
  2829	So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung
  2830	With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
  2831	Crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like Thessalian bulls;
  2832	Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
  2833	Each under each. A cry more tuneable
  2834	Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
  2835	In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.
  2836	Judge when you hear.--But, soft, what nymphs are these?
  2837	
  2838	EGEUS
  2839	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
  2840	And this Lysander; this Demetrius is;
  2841	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
  2842	I wonder of their being here together.
  2843	
  2844	THESEUS
  2845	No doubt they rose up early to observe
  2846	The rite of May; and, hearing our intent,
  2847	Came here in grace of our solemnity.--
  2848	But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
  2849	That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
  2850	
  2851	EGEUS
  2852	It is, my lord.
  2853	
  2854	THESEUS
  2855	Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
  2856	
  2857	[Horns, and shout within. DEMETRIUS, LYSANDER,HERMIA, and HELENA
  2858	awake and start up.]
  2859	
  2860	Good-morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past;
  2861	Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
  2862	
  2863	LYSANDER
  2864	Pardon, my lord.
  2865	
  2866	[He and the rest kneel to THESEUS.]
  2867	
  2868	THESEUS
  2869	                 I pray you all, stand up.
  2870	I know you two are rival enemies;
  2871	How comes this gentle concord in the world,
  2872	That hatred is so far from jealousy
  2873	To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
  2874	
  2875	LYSANDER
  2876	My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
  2877	Half 'sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,
  2878	I cannot truly say how I came here:
  2879	But, as I think,--for truly would I speak--
  2880	And now I do bethink me, so it is,--
  2881	I came with Hermia hither: our intent
  2882	Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be,
  2883	Without the peril of the Athenian law.
  2884	
  2885	EGEUS
  2886	Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough;
  2887	I beg the law, the law upon his head.--
  2888	They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius,
  2889	Thereby to have defeated you and me:
  2890	You of your wife, and me of my consent,--
  2891	Of my consent that she should be your wife.
  2892	
  2893	DEMETRIUS
  2894	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  2895	Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
  2896	And I in fury hither follow'd them,
  2897	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
  2898	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
  2899	But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
  2900	Melted as the snow--seems to me now
  2901	As the remembrance of an idle gawd
  2902	Which in my childhood I did dote upon:
  2903	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
  2904	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
  2905	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
  2906	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
  2907	But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
  2908	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
  2909	Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
  2910	And will for evermore be true to it.
  2911	
  2912	THESEUS
  2913	Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
  2914	Of this discourse we more will hear anon.--
  2915	Egeus, I will overbear your will;
  2916	For in the temple, by and by with us,
  2917	These couples shall eternally be knit.
  2918	And, for the morning now is something worn,
  2919	Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.--
  2920	Away with us to Athens, three and three,
  2921	We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.--
  2922	Come, Hippolyta.
  2923	
  2924	[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and Train.]
  2925	
  2926	DEMETRIUS
  2927	These things seem small and undistinguishable,
  2928	Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
  2929	
  2930	HERMIA
  2931	Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
  2932	When every thing seems double.
  2933	
  2934	HELENA
  2935	                               So methinks:
  2936	And I have found Demetrius like a jewel.
  2937	Mine own, and not mine own.
  2938	
  2939	DEMETRIUS
  2940	                            It seems to me
  2941	That yet we sleep, we dream.--Do not you think
  2942	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
  2943	
  2944	HERMIA
  2945	Yea, and my father.
  2946	
  2947	HELENA
  2948	                    And Hippolyta.
  2949	
  2950	LYSANDER
  2951	And he did bid us follow to the temple.
  2952	
  2953	DEMETRIUS
  2954	Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him;
  2955	And by the way let us recount our dreams.
  2956	
  2957	[Exeunt.]
  2958	
  2959	[As they go out, BOTTOM awakes.]
  2960	
  2961	BOTTOM
  2962	When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is 'Most
  2963	fair Pyramus.'--Heigh-ho!--Peter Quince! Flute, the
  2964	bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God's my life,
  2965	stol'n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
  2966	vision. I have had a dream--past the wit of man to say
  2967	what dream it was.--Man is but an ass if he go about
  2968	to expound this dream. Methought I was--there is no man can tell
  2969	what. Methought I was, and methought I had,--but man is but a
  2970	patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The
  2971	eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen; man's
  2972	hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart
  2973	to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a
  2974	ballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because
  2975	it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a
  2976	play, before the duke: peradventure, to make it the more
  2977	gracious, I shall sing it at her death.
  2978	
  2979	[Exit.]
  2980	
  2981	
  2982	
  2983	SCENE II. Athens. A Room in QUINCE'S House.
  2984	
  2985	[Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING.]
  2986	
  2987	QUINCE
  2988	Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
  2989	
  2990	STARVELING
  2991	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt, he is transported.
  2992	
  2993	FLUTE
  2994	If he come not, then the play is marred; it goes not
  2995	forward, doth it?
  2996	
  2997	QUINCE
  2998	It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens
  2999	able to discharge Pyramus but he.
  3000	
  3001	FLUTE
  3002	No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
  3003	Athens.
  3004	
  3005	QUINCE
  3006	Yea, and the best person too: and he is a very paramour
  3007	for a sweet voice.
  3008	
  3009	FLUTE
  3010	You must say paragon: a paramour is, God bless us, a thing of
  3011	naught.
  3012	
  3013	[Enter SNUG.]
  3014	
  3015	SNUG
  3016	Masters, the duke is coming from the temple; and there is
  3017	two or three lords and ladies more married: if our sport had gone
  3018	forward, we had all been made men.
  3019	
  3020	FLUTE
  3021	O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
  3022	during his life; he could not have 'scaped sixpence a-day; an
  3023	the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing Pyramus,
  3024	I'll be hanged; he would have deserved it: sixpence a-day in
  3025	Pyramus, or nothing.
  3026	
  3027	[Enter BOTTOM.]
  3028	
  3029	BOTTOM
  3030	Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
  3031	
  3032	QUINCE
  3033	Bottom!--O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
  3034	
  3035	BOTTOM
  3036	Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
  3037	what; for if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you
  3038	everything, right as it fell out.
  3039	
  3040	QUINCE
  3041	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
  3042	
  3043	BOTTOM
  3044	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the
  3045	duke hath dined. Get your apparel together; good strings to
  3046	your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the
  3047	palace; every man look over his part; for the short and the long
  3048	is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have clean
  3049	linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for
  3050	they shall hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors,
  3051	eat no onions nor garlick, for we are to utter sweet breath; and
  3052	I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more
  3053	words: away! go; away!
  3054	
  3055	[Exeunt.]
  3056	
  3057	
  3058	
  3059	ACT V
  3060	
  3061	SCENE I. Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of THESEUS.
  3062	
  3063	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords, and Attendants.]
  3064	
  3065	HIPPOLYTA
  3066	'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
  3067	
  3068	THESEUS
  3069	More strange than true. I never may believe
  3070	These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  3071	Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  3072	Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
  3073	More than cool reason ever comprehends.
  3074	The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
  3075	Are of imagination all compact:
  3076	One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
  3077	That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
  3078	Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
  3079	The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
  3080	Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
  3081	And as imagination bodies forth
  3082	The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
  3083	Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
  3084	A local habitation and a name.
  3085	Such tricks hath strong imagination,
  3086	That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
  3087	It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
  3088	Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  3089	How easy is a bush supposed a bear?
  3090	
  3091	HIPPOLYTA
  3092	But all the story of the night told over,
  3093	And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
  3094	More witnesseth than fancy's images,
  3095	And grows to something of great constancy;
  3096	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
  3097	
  3098	[Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA.]
  3099	
  3100	THESEUS
  3101	Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.--
  3102	Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
  3103	Accompany your hearts!
  3104	
  3105	LYSANDER
  3106	                       More than to us
  3107	Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
  3108	
  3109	THESEUS
  3110	Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
  3111	To wear away this long age of three hours
  3112	Between our after-supper and bed-time?
  3113	Where is our usual manager of mirth?
  3114	What revels are in hand? Is there no play
  3115	To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
  3116	Call Philostrate.
  3117	
  3118	PHILOSTRATE
  3119	                  Here, mighty Theseus.
  3120	
  3121	THESEUS
  3122	Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
  3123	What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
  3124	The lazy time, if not with some delight?
  3125	
  3126	PHILOSTRATE
  3127	There is a brief how many sports are ripe;
  3128	Make choice of which your highness will see first.
  3129	
  3130	[Giving a paper.]
  3131	
  3132	THESEUS
  3133	[Reads.]
  3134	  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
  3135	  By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
  3136	We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
  3137	In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
  3138	  'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
  3139	  Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
  3140	That is an old device, and it was play'd
  3141	When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
  3142	  'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
  3143	  Of learning, late deceas'd in beggary.'
  3144	That is some satire, keen and critical,
  3145	Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
  3146	  'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
  3147	  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
  3148	Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
  3149	That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
  3150	How shall we find the concord of this discord?
  3151	
  3152	PHILOSTRATE
  3153	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
  3154	Which is as brief as I have known a play;
  3155	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
  3156	Which makes it tedious: for in all the play
  3157	There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
  3158	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
  3159	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself:
  3160	Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,
  3161	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
  3162	The passion of loud laughter never shed.
  3163	
  3164	THESEUS
  3165	What are they that do play it?
  3166	
  3167	PHILOSTRATE
  3168	Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
  3169	Which never labour'd in their minds till now;
  3170	And now have toil'd their unbreath'd memories
  3171	With this same play against your nuptial.
  3172	
  3173	THESEUS
  3174	And we will hear it.
  3175	
  3176	PHILOSTRATE
  3177	                     No, my noble lord,
  3178	It is not for you: I have heard it over,
  3179	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
  3180	Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  3181	Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  3182	To do you service.
  3183	
  3184	THESEUS
  3185	                   I will hear that play;
  3186	For never anything can be amiss
  3187	When simpleness and duty tender it.
  3188	Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
  3189	
  3190	[Exit PHILOSTRATE.]
  3191	
  3192	HIPPOLYTA
  3193	I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
  3194	And duty in his service perishing.
  3195	
  3196	THESEUS
  3197	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
  3198	
  3199	HIPPOLYTA
  3200	He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  3201	
  3202	THESEUS
  3203	The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
  3204	Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
  3205	And what poor duty cannot do,
  3206	Noble respect takes it in might, not merit.
  3207	Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
  3208	To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
  3209	Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
  3210	Make periods in the midst of sentences,
  3211	Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
  3212	And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
  3213	Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  3214	Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
  3215	And in the modesty of fearful duty
  3216	I read as much as from the rattling tongue
  3217	Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
  3218	Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
  3219	In least speak most to my capacity.
  3220	
  3221	[Enter PHILOSTRATE.]
  3222	
  3223	PHILOSTRATE
  3224	So please your grace, the prologue is address'd.
  3225	
  3226	THESEUS
  3227	Let him approach.
  3228	
  3229	[Flourish of trumpets. Enter PROLOGUE.]
  3230	
  3231	PROLOGUE
  3232	'If we offend, it is with our good will.
  3233	  That you should think, we come not to offend,
  3234	But with good will.  To show our simple skill,
  3235	  That is the true beginning of our end.
  3236	Consider then, we come but in despite.
  3237	  We do not come, as minding to content you,
  3238	Our true intent is.  All for your delight
  3239	  We are not here.  That you should here repent you,
  3240	The actors are at hand: and, by their show,
  3241	You shall know all that you are like to know,'
  3242	
  3243	THESEUS
  3244	This fellow doth not stand upon points.
  3245	
  3246	LYSANDER
  3247	He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
  3248	not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak,
  3249	but to speak true.
  3250	
  3251	HIPPOLYTA
  3252	Indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child
  3253	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
  3254	
  3255	THESEUS
  3256	His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all
  3257	disordered. Who is next?
  3258	
  3259	[Enter PYRAMUS and THISBE, WALL, MOONSHINE, and LION, as in dumb
  3260	show.]
  3261	
  3262	PROLOGUE
  3263	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  3264	  But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
  3265	This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
  3266	  This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
  3267	This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
  3268	  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
  3269	And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
  3270	  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.
  3271	This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
  3272	  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,
  3273	By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
  3274	  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
  3275	This grisly beast, which by name Lion hight,
  3276	The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
  3277	Did scare away, or rather did affright;
  3278	And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
  3279	  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain:
  3280	Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,
  3281	  And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
  3282	Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
  3283	  He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
  3284	And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
  3285	  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
  3286	Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
  3287	At large discourse while here they do remain.
  3288	
  3289	[Exeunt PROLOGUE, THISBE, LION, and MOONSHINE.]
  3290	
  3291	THESEUS
  3292	I wonder if the lion be to speak.
  3293	
  3294	DEMETRIUS
  3295	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
  3296	
  3297	WALL
  3298	In this same interlude it doth befall
  3299	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall:
  3300	And such a wall as I would have you think
  3301	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
  3302	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
  3303	Did whisper often very secretly.
  3304	This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
  3305	That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
  3306	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
  3307	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
  3308	
  3309	THESEUS
  3310	Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
  3311	
  3312	DEMETRIUS
  3313	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
  3314	discourse, my lord.
  3315	
  3316	THESEUS
  3317	Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
  3318	
  3319	[Enter PYRAMUS.]
  3320	
  3321	PYRAMUS
  3322	O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  3323	  O night, which ever art when day is not!
  3324	O night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
  3325	 I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!--
  3326	And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
  3327	 That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
  3328	Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  3329	  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
  3330	
  3331	[WALL holds up his fingers.]
  3332	
  3333	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
  3334	  But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.
  3335	O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,
  3336	  Curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
  3337	
  3338	THESEUS
  3339	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
  3340	
  3341	PYRAMUS
  3342	No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' is
  3343	Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through
  3344	the wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you.--Yonder
  3345	she comes.
  3346	
  3347	[Enter THISBE.]
  3348	
  3349	THISBE
  3350	O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
  3351	  For parting my fair Pyramus and me:
  3352	My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones:
  3353	  Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
  3354	
  3355	PYRAMUS
  3356	I see a voice; now will I to the chink,
  3357	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.
  3358	Thisby!
  3359	
  3360	THISBE
  3361	        My love! thou art my love, I think.
  3362	
  3363	PYRAMUS
  3364	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
  3365	And like Limander am I trusty still.
  3366	
  3367	THISBE
  3368	And I like Helen, till the fates me kill.
  3369	
  3370	PYRAMUS
  3371	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  3372	
  3373	THISBE
  3374	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
  3375	
  3376	PYRAMUS
  3377	O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
  3378	
  3379	THISBE
  3380	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
  3381	
  3382	PYRAMUS
  3383	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
  3384	
  3385	THISBE
  3386	'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
  3387	
  3388	WALL
  3389	Thus have I, wall, my part discharged so;
  3390	And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
  3391	
  3392	[Exeunt WALL, PYRAMUS and THISBE.]
  3393	
  3394	THESEUS
  3395	Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
  3396	
  3397	DEMETRIUS
  3398	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
  3399	without warning.
  3400	
  3401	HIPPOLYTA
  3402	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  3403	
  3404	THESEUS
  3405	The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
  3406	are no worse, if imagination amend them.
  3407	
  3408	HIPPOLYTA
  3409	It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  3410	
  3411	THESEUS
  3412	If we imagine no worse of them than they of
  3413	themselves, they may pass for excellent men.
  3414	Here come two noble beasts in, a moon and a lion.
  3415	
  3416	[Enter LION and MOONSHINE.]
  3417	
  3418	LION
  3419	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
  3420	  The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
  3421	May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,
  3422	  When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
  3423	Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
  3424	A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam:
  3425	For, if I should as lion come in strife
  3426	Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
  3427	
  3428	THESEUS
  3429	A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  3430	
  3431	DEMETRIUS
  3432	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  3433	
  3434	LYSANDER
  3435	This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  3436	
  3437	THESEUS
  3438	True; and a goose for his discretion.
  3439	
  3440	DEMETRIUS
  3441	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
  3442	discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
  3443	
  3444	THESEUS
  3445	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
  3446	for the goose carries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his
  3447	discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
  3448	
  3449	MOONSHINE
  3450	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present:
  3451	
  3452	DEMETRIUS
  3453	He should have worn the horns on his head.
  3454	
  3455	THESEUS
  3456	He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within
  3457	the circumference.
  3458	
  3459	MOONSHINE
  3460	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
  3461	Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
  3462	
  3463	THESEUS
  3464	This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man should be
  3465	put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' the moon?
  3466	
  3467	DEMETRIUS
  3468	He dares not come there for the candle: for, you
  3469	see, it is already in snuff.
  3470	
  3471	HIPPOLYTA
  3472	I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
  3473	
  3474	THESEUS
  3475	It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he
  3476	is in the wane: but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must
  3477	stay the time.
  3478	
  3479	LYSANDER
  3480	Proceed, moon.
  3481	
  3482	MOON
  3483	All that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern
  3484	is the moon; I, the man i' the moon; this thorn-bush, my
  3485	thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
  3486	
  3487	DEMETRIUS
  3488	Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all
  3489	these are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisbe.
  3490	
  3491	[Enter THISBE.]
  3492	
  3493	THISBE
  3494	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
  3495	
  3496	LION
  3497	Oh!
  3498	
  3499	[The LION roars.--THISBE runs off.]
  3500	
  3501	DEMETRIUS
  3502	Well roared, lion.
  3503	
  3504	THESEUS
  3505	Well run, Thisbe.
  3506	
  3507	HIPPOLYTA
  3508	Well shone, moon.--Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.
  3509	
  3510	[The LION tears THISBE'S Mantle, and exit.]
  3511	
  3512	THESEUS
  3513	Well moused, lion.
  3514	
  3515	DEMETRIUS
  3516	And so comes Pyramus.
  3517	
  3518	LYSANDER
  3519	And then the lion vanishes.
  3520	
  3521	[Enter PYRAMUS.]
  3522	
  3523	PYRAMUS
  3524	Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  3525	  I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright:
  3526	For, by thy gracious golden, glittering streams,
  3527	  I trust to take of truest Thisby's sight.
  3528	      But stay;--O spite!
  3529	      But mark,--poor knight,
  3530	    What dreadful dole is here!
  3531	      Eyes, do you see?
  3532	      How can it be?
  3533	    O dainty duck! O dear!
  3534	      Thy mantle good,
  3535	      What! stained with blood?
  3536	    Approach, ye furies fell!
  3537	      O fates! come, come;
  3538	      Cut thread and thrum;
  3539	    Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!
  3540	
  3541	THESEUS
  3542	This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go
  3543	near to make a man look sad.
  3544	
  3545	HIPPOLYTA
  3546	Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
  3547	
  3548	PYRAMUS
  3549	O wherefore, nature, didst thou lions frame?
  3550	  Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
  3551	Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
  3552	  That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
  3553	      Come, tears, confound;
  3554	      Out, sword, and wound
  3555	    The pap of Pyramus:
  3556	      Ay, that left pap,
  3557	      Where heart doth hop:--
  3558	    Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
  3559	      Now am I dead,
  3560	      Now am I fled;
  3561	    My soul is in the sky:
  3562	      Tongue, lose thy light!
  3563	      Moon, take thy flight!
  3564	    Now die, die, die, die, die.
  3565	
  3566	[Dies. Exit MOONSHINE.]
  3567	
  3568	DEMETRIUS
  3569	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
  3570	
  3571	LYSANDER
  3572	Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
  3573	
  3574	THESEUS
  3575	With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.
  3576	
  3577	HIPPOLYTA
  3578	How chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
  3579	back and finds her lover?
  3580	
  3581	THESEUS
  3582	She will find him by starlight.--Here she comes; and
  3583	her passion ends the play.
  3584	
  3585	[Enter THISBE.]
  3586	
  3587	HIPPOLYTA
  3588	Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
  3589	Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
  3590	
  3591	DEMETRIUS
  3592	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
  3593	Thisbe, is the better.
  3594	
  3595	LYSANDER
  3596	She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
  3597	
  3598	DEMETRIUS
  3599	And thus she moans, videlicet.--
  3600	
  3601	THISBE
  3602	     Asleep, my love?
  3603	     What, dead, my dove?
  3604	   O Pyramus, arise,
  3605	     Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
  3606	     Dead, dead? A tomb
  3607	   Must cover thy sweet eyes.
  3608	     These lily lips,
  3609	     This cherry nose,
  3610	   These yellow cowslip cheeks,
  3611	     Are gone, are gone:
  3612	     Lovers, make moan!
  3613	   His eyes were green as leeks.
  3614	     O Sisters Three,
  3615	     Come, come to me,
  3616	   With hands as pale as milk;
  3617	     Lay them in gore,
  3618	     Since you have shore
  3619	   With shears his thread of silk.
  3620	     Tongue, not a word:--
  3621	     Come, trusty sword;
  3622	   Come, blade, my breast imbrue;
  3623	     And farewell, friends:--
  3624	     Thus Thisbe ends;
  3625	   Adieu, adieu, adieu.
  3626	
  3627	[Dies.]
  3628	
  3629	THESEUS
  3630	Moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead.
  3631	
  3632	DEMETRIUS
  3633	Ay, and wall too.
  3634	
  3635	BOTTOM
  3636	No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers.
  3637	Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask
  3638	dance between two of our company?
  3639	
  3640	THESEUS
  3641	No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
  3642	excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there
  3643	need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played
  3644	Pyramus, and hang'd himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have
  3645	been a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
  3646	discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.
  3647	
  3648	[Here a dance of Clowns.]
  3649	
  3650	The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:--
  3651	Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  3652	I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,
  3653	As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
  3654	This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
  3655	The heavy gait of night.--Sweet friends, to bed.--
  3656	A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
  3657	In nightly revels and new jollity.
  3658	
  3659	[Exeunt.]
  3660	
  3661	
  3662	
  3663	SCENE II
  3664	
  3665	[Enter PUCK.]
  3666	
  3667	PUCK
  3668	  Now the hungry lion roars,
  3669	   And the wolf behowls the moon;
  3670	  Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
  3671	   All with weary task fordone.
  3672	  Now the wasted brands do glow,
  3673	   Whilst the scritch-owl, scritching loud,
  3674	  Puts the wretch that lies in woe
  3675	   In remembrance of a shroud.
  3676	  Now it is the time of night
  3677	   That the graves, all gaping wide,
  3678	  Every one lets forth its sprite,
  3679	   In the church-way paths to glide:
  3680	  And we fairies, that do run
  3681	   By the triple Hecate's team
  3682	  From the presence of the sun,
  3683	   Following darkness like a dream,
  3684	  Now are frolic; not a mouse
  3685	   Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
  3686	  I am sent with broom before,
  3687	   To sweep the dust behind the door.
  3688	
  3689	[Enter OBERON and TITANIA, with their Train.]
  3690	
  3691	OBERON
  3692	  Through the house give glimmering light,
  3693	    By the dead and drowsy fire:
  3694	  Every elf and fairy sprite
  3695	    Hop as light as bird from brier:
  3696	  And this ditty, after me,
  3697	  Sing and dance it trippingly.
  3698	
  3699	TITANIA
  3700	  First, rehearse your song by rote,
  3701	    To each word a warbling note;
  3702	  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
  3703	  Will we sing, and bless this place.
  3704	
  3705	[Song and Dance.]
  3706	
  3707	OBERON
  3708	  Now, until the break of day,
  3709	  Through this house each fairy stray,
  3710	  To the best bride-bed will we,
  3711	  Which by us shall blessed be;
  3712	  And the issue there create
  3713	  Ever shall be fortunate.
  3714	  So shall all the couples three
  3715	  Ever true in loving be;
  3716	  And the blots of Nature's hand
  3717	  Shall not in their issue stand:
  3718	  Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
  3719	  Nor mark prodigious, such as are
  3720	  Despised in nativity,
  3721	  Shall upon their children be.--
  3722	  With this field-dew consecrate,
  3723	  Every fairy take his gate;
  3724	  And each several chamber bless,
  3725	  Through this palace, with sweet peace;
  3726	  E'er shall it in safety rest,
  3727	  And the owner of it blest.
  3728	    Trip away:
  3729	    Make no stay:
  3730	  Meet me all by break of day.
  3731	
  3732	[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and Train.]
  3733	
  3734	PUCK
  3735	  If we shadows have offended,
  3736	  Think but this,--and all is mended,--
  3737	  That you have but slumber'd here
  3738	  While these visions did appear.
  3739	  And this weak and idle theme,
  3740	  No more yielding but a dream,
  3741	  Gentles, do not reprehend;
  3742	  If you pardon, we will mend.
  3743	  And, as I am an honest Puck,
  3744	  If we have unearned luck
  3745	  Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
  3746	  We will make amends ere long;
  3747	  Else the Puck a liar call:
  3748	  So, good night unto you all.
  3749	  Give me your hands, if we be friends,
  3750	  And Robin shall restore amends.
  3751
